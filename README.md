# Faster than a Rocketbean
*Faster than a Rocketbean* is a 3D-Action-Build-Up game in which you become the head of a huge Space Mafia. Start with nothing, sell asteroid material, hire crew members, upgrade your ship and rule the whole universe!

This game was part of the [Beansjam 2017](http://jams.gamejolt.io/beansjam) - in other words, it was crafted in 48 hours. For a more detailed description, make sure to check out its [Gamejolt page](http://gamejolt.com/games/Beansjam2017/257203).

The branch **master** includes everything which was part of the Game Jam. **Bugfixing** is a branch which has been created to implement some minor improvements or bug fixes for the sake of making the game a little more enjoyable.

Faster than a Rocketbean was created using the [Unity Engine](https://unity3d.com).

We crafted the game from scratch, including all scripts, models and the music - but we also used some pre-made assets from various sources:
 * [SpaceSkies Free](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/80503)
 * [Unity Particle Pack](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/73777)
 * [Spaceport 2006](http://www.dafont.com/spaceport-2006.font)
 * We also used images by the NASA for the planet's textures.
